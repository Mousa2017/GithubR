You need to obtain a data that shows all boroughs and neighborhoods in Boston city as well as their latitude and longitude (22 boroughs and 104 neighborhoods). Dorchester borough has 16 neighborhoods. Using Foursquare location data, you would be able to obtain exact locations of Dorchester’s neighborhoods, then start analyzing the nearby venues in each neighborhoods. Hence, the dataset should reflect a table with four attributes; boroughs, neighborhoods, latitude and longitude. The dataset is available on internet so it would be compiled from different sources to form the above-mentioned table.
